# Weather-Dashboard
This application required the use of an API key.  OpenWeather API, was what was used to create this application.  At first I attempted to do the app statically, but with a tutor decided to create the app dynamically.  This homework was quite a challenge, and had to use the knowledge of the last three assignments.

# Technology
Javascript, Jquery, CSS, HTML, Font Awesome, Google Fonts, Bootstrap, and moment js.
